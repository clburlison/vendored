Vendored

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Concepts from this repo stem largely from https://github.com/google/macops/tree/master/packages. The goal of this repo make it easy to "vendor" your own frameworks in an easy and automated fashion. This will allow you to have your own version of python, ruby, pyojbc bridge, etc. all in one nice big package or multiple smaller packages.

At least that's the goal when this project is complete.
